#Program 1 â€“ Timesheet
#Description:   Design and write a program that accepts the number of hours worked on 
#               each of five work days from the user, then displays different 
#               information calculated about those entries as output.

"""
For this assignment, I tried to put everything into functions and then use those functions as pseudo-code. I used a "try/except" statement I learned
from a youtube short, it may be a bit janky; I'm still not 100% how to use it and I probably overcoded it, but it works so I'm going to leave it for now.
